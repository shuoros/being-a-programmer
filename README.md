# Free Joys Of Being A Programmer

I recently read a book that collected 700 free joys of life. Things like: scratching the socks mark on your feet, coolness on the other side of the pillow, when you reach the traffic light, and it turns green right away, when you find money in your old clothes pocket, and things like that.

I asked myself why programmers do not list the free joys that they experience when they code.
